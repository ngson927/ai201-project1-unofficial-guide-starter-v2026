# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** no fixed size — one chunk per `##` section, with `CHUNK_SIZE`
(800) acting as a ceiling rather than a window. Result: 94 chunks, 318
characters on average, shortest 172, longest 758.
**Overlap:** none. `CHUNK_OVERLAP` is still used by `fallback_split` but my
chunker ignores it.

The corpus is 14 long guides already carved into labelled sections — "Getting
there", "Eat and drink", "When to go". I counted 98 of these sections: median
284 characters, 90th percentile 440, longest 711. **Every one of them already
fit inside the starter's 800-character window.** So the fixed-window chunker
wasn't splitting because sections were too big. It was splitting blindly, at
offsets that had nothing to do with the document, and cutting through
boundaries that were already there. Measured on the baseline: 35 of 51 chunks
started mid-sentence, 42 of 51 held pieces of two or more unrelated sections,
and the shortest chunk was 24 characters — `'d Sundays and after 5pm.'`

Splitting at the headings instead takes mid-sentence starts to 0 of 94 and
multi-section chunks to 0 of 94. Overlap then stops earning its keep: overlap
exists to soften the damage when a fixed window severs a thought at an
arbitrary point, and if you split on real boundaries there is no arbitrary
point to soften.

The change that mattered more than the size, though, was context. A section
body almost never names its own town — six of the seven sections in
`guide_kestrelford.md` never contain the word "Kestrelford". The chunk holding
the bakery fact had nothing in it for "when does the Kestrelford bakery sell
out?" to match on. So every chunk is prefixed with its document title and
heading (`Kestrelford — Eat and drink`), which puts the town and the topic into
the text that actually gets embedded. All 8 Kestrelford chunks now name the
town; that question now retrieves the right chunk at distance 0.416 and
answers correctly.

Two things I did not fix. Sections shorter than 120 characters are merged
forward into the next one, because a bare heading with nothing under it is not
worth retrieving — but that threshold is a guess from the size distribution
(the smallest real section is 174 characters), not something I tested. And the
9 documents that repeat the same "Practical notes" boilerplate still produce 9
near-identical chunks, one of which contradicts `guide_accessibility.md` about
where the nearest hospital is. Chunking can't fix that; it's a corpus problem,
and it's what I expect to fail in unit 2.

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — source: `guide_accessibility.md#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Getting around the region with limited mobility

An honest assessment rather than a promotional one. Some of these places are
difficult and it is better to know in advance.
```

This is the weakest of the five and I'm keeping it in rather than cherry-picking
around it. It's a document preamble, so it has a title but no `##` heading, and
on its own it answers nothing — it tells you a guide exists, not what's in it.
Every other chunk in the corpus is a real section.

**Chunk 2** — source: `guide_corry_vale.md#5` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Corry Vale — Where to stay

Perhaps thirty beds in the entire valley, spread across two pubs and a handful of farmhouse rooms. In summer these are booked months ahead. Camping is permitted on two marked fields and nowhere else.
```

Answers "where can I stay in Corry Vale?" on its own, including the number of
beds and the camping rule.

**Chunk 3** — source: `guide_givens_mill.md#2` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Givens Mill — Getting around

Everything is on one street along the river. The mill is at one end and the church at the other, eight minutes apart. The riverside path continues in both directions for as far as you want to walk.
```

Without the prefix this would be three sentences about an unnamed village. The
body never says "Givens Mill".

**Chunk 4** — source: `guide_kestrelford.md#4` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Kestrelford — What to see

The market square on a Saturday morning is the main event and has run continuously since the 1400s. The parish church has a 13th-century tower you can climb for £2. The old trackbed walk runs six miles to the next village along an easy gradient and is the best half-day here.
```

Three distinct facts with hard numbers — £2, six miles, the 1400s — and it can
answer a question about any of them alone.

**Chunk 5** — source: `guide_pellew_sands.md#6` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Pellew Sands — When to go

June and September for the beach without the crowds. July and August are busy and the town is at its most itself, for better and worse. Winter is bleak, largely closed, and has a following among people who like that sort of thing.
```

Answers "when should I visit Pellew Sands?" completely, and the prefix is what
distinguishes it from the eight other "When to go" sections in the corpus.

## Sample Answer

**My relevance cutoff:**

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
