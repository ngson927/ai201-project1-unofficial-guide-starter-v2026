"""
Your test questions.

Milestone 2 asks you to write five questions your system should be able to
answer from your corpus, specific enough to have a right answer.

  ✗ "What are good dining halls?"          — no right answer
  ✓ "What do students say about wait times at Commons during lunch?"

Fill in `QUESTIONS` below. `expects` is a word or short phrase you'd expect a
correct answer to contain — you'll use it in unit 2 when you build a scorer,
and having written it now means you decided what "correct" meant before you saw
any results.

`OUT_OF_SCOPE` holds five questions your documents clearly don't cover. You
need these in Milestone 4 to find where your relevance cutoff belongs, and
again in unit 2, where `run_eval.py` runs them through the gate and writes what
happened into your run log — that's the evidence for criterion 3.

Swap them for your own if you like. Keep five of them either way: criterion 3
names a target of "4 of 5", and four of three is not a thing.

QUESTIONS = [
    # Every `expects` string below appears verbatim in the corpus, so a
    # substring scorer will not mark a correct answer wrong on a paraphrase.

    # Single fact, stated in two documents (guide_kestrelford, guide_eating).
    {
        "question": "When does the Kestrelford bakery sell out?",
        "expects": "11am",
    },
    # Single fact in one document only — the narrowest question here.
    {
        "question": "How much does it cost to climb the church tower in Kestrelford?",
        "expects": "£2",
    },
    # Stated in guide_marchwood and again in guide_accessibility.
    {
        "question": "How often do the trams run in Marchwood on weekdays?",
        "expects": "8 minutes",
    },
    # The answer is spread across a section rather than sitting in one
    # sentence: the lots, the time they fill, and the overflow walk.
    {
        "question": "What is the parking situation in Halden Bay on a summer weekend?",
        "expects": "10am",
    },
    # Deliberately the hard one. Nine documents repeat a boilerplate block
    # saying the nearest full hospital is in Brightwater; only
    # guide_accessibility.md says Marchwood, and it is the one that is right.
    # I expect this to fail, and I would rather find that out than not ask.

        "question": "Where is the nearest full hospital in the region?",

# Questions from a different world entirely. Your gate should refuse all five.
#
# There are five of these because criterion 3 in criteria.md names a target of
# "at least 4 of 5" — you need five things to try before you can report 4 of 5.
# `run_eval.py` runs these through retrieval and the gate on every eval and
# records what happened, so criterion 3 has evidence in the run log alongside
# the others. They cost no model calls: a refusal never reaches the model.
